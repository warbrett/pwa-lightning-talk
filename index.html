            * Kurt Cobain had died two years earlier<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
            * There was a new sound gracing the airwaves.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
            * The Macarena<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
            * Also: CSS was released and JavaScript was created.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
            Note: after Bullet 2: Something much more modern, easier to dance to, so easy to dance to that it would become everyone's most dreaded moment at every wedding going forward(playsong)

            ## The year was 2005
            * We still had to do the Macarena awkwardly at weddings.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
            * Kayne had just dropped Gold Digger, 50 Cent was still relevant.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
            * And people still openly admitted that they liked Coldplay.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
            * AJAX became a top hit..<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
            Note: Song on bullet 3, say on bullet 4: AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, that's right we used to use XML. Basically it was just using javascript to fetch data and live update the page without requiring someone to hit the refresh button or navigate to a new view. This was groundbreaking.

            * The term Responsive had just been coined.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
            Note: Post bullet 3: Now responsive sites had actually been around much longer, with the fist being a demo by Audi in 2001. But it wasn't until 2010 that we had a good word for them. Anyone remember the other words for responsive sites? Fluid, Elastic, annoying to make.

            ## So what are Progresive Web Applications
            * They're websites.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
            * They take advantage of some new API's and browser features.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
            * Available offline(Service Worker), Secure(https), Responsive, Web App Manifest, and Non-blocking page transitions.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
            Note: these features combined give the sites some really cool advantages, for example the ability to be added to the home screen on phones, instant app-like feel. So lets go over a few them

            * Some sites benefit a lot more - web based CRMs, social networks, anything with a login page anything where marketing tells you to make an "app"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
