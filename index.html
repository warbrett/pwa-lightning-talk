            ## The year was 1992
            * Nirvana was changing music forever.
            * Kurt Cobain was still alive.
            * And a small organization put the first website on the internet
            Note: It didn't have midi music, spinning skull gifs, frames or even pictures. This was a website

            ## First Site

          Note: The next several years were explosive, websites received images, colors, and a lot of the things that make them more modern. But the next big thing didn't happen until...

            ## The Year was 1996
            * Kurt Cobain had died two years earlier
            * There was a new sound gracing the airwaves.
            * The Macarena
            * Also: CSS was released and JavaScript was created.
          Note: Something much more modern, easier to dance to, so easy to dance to that it would become everyone's most dreaded moment at every wedding going forward

            ## The year was 2005
              * We still had to do the Macarena awkwardly at large social gatherings.
              * Kayne had just dropped Gold Digger, 50 Cent was still relevant.
              * And people still openly said that they liked Coldplay.
              * The term Responsive had just been coined
            Note: Now responsive sites had actually been around much longer, with the fist being a demo by Audi in 2001. But it wasn't until 2010 that we had a good word for them. Anyone remember the other words for responsive sites? Fluid, Elastic, annoying to make.

              * Popular music was good again.
              * Ke$ha, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars, and Jason Derulo were among the top hits.

            * Popular music is a little more bipolar than it was 8 years ago
            * Billboard top hits as of January 4th Have everything from Lil Pump and Cardi B to Taylor Swift and Becky G
            * We now have progressive enhancements.

            ## So what are Progresive Web Applications
            * They're websites
            * They take advantage of some new API's and browser features
            * Available offline(Service Worker), Secure(https), Responsive, Web App Manifest, and Non-blocking page transitions
          Note: these features combined give the site's some really cool advatnages, for example the ability to be added to the home screen on phones, instant  app-like feel

            ## Service Worker?
            * Basically a magical little fairy(Browser APIs) that allows you to:
            * Cache Data
            * Do background syncing
            * Push Notifications
            * and more!

            ## Web App Manifest
            * Really simple file you link from the head of your html document.
            * Baasically a list of your site's settings
            * How to display on mobile
            * Icon

            ## Who's it for
            * Most sites would benefit from these features
            * Some sites a little less - Brochure sites, Local restuarant that just sohws a menu
            * Some sites a lot more - web based CRMs, social networks, anything with a login page anything where marketing tells you to make an "app"

            ## What's in the future
            * Microsoft automatically adding sites that are PWA's the window's store
            * Chrome has them fully implemented on mobile
            * Mobile Firefox will with their next few updates
            * Safari is actively working on it.
            Note: Important to note that all of these things are enhancements, the websites shouldn't break if a browser A is lacking a few features compaored to browser B.
